Backup of a script and a desktop icon for deployment at FI.
Before the workshop, the deploy script needs to be called once
(on any computer, because home directories are shared),
including the currently commented lines.

For some technical reasons (related to shared home directories),
participants must open a web browser using a desktop icon,
that's why we call jupyter notebook with `--no-browser` option.
